And if they ask, 'Have you eaten yet?' there is no content related to the past, so output ['x']. Another example is, if someone says, '\uc5b4\uc81c \uc6b0\ub9ac \uc74c\uc2dd \uc598\uae30 \ud588\uc5c8\uc796\uc544' create it like this: ['\uc5b4\uc81c', '\uc74c\uc2dd']."}, {"name": "dog_persona", "content": "I have a 'persona'.
